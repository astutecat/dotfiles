Designing a computer system is very different from designing an algorithm: The external interface (that is, the requirement) is less precisely defined, more complex, and more subject to change. The system has much more internal structure, and hence many internal interfaces. The measure of success is much less clear. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
There probably isn't a 'best' way to build the system, or even any major part of it; much more important is to avoid choosing a terrible way, and to have clear division of responsibilities among the parts. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Defining interfaces is the most important part of system design. Usually it is also the most difficult, since the interface design must satisfy three conflicting requirements: an interface should be simple, it should be complete, and it should admit a sufficiently small and fast implementation. Alas, all too often the assumptions embodied in an interface turn out to be misconceptions instead. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
The main reason interfaces are difficult to design is that each interface is a small programming language: it defines a set of objects and the operations that can be used to manipulate the objects. Concrete syntax is not an issue, but every other aspect of programming language design is present. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Do one thing at a time, and do it well. An interface should capture the minimum essentials of an abstraction. Don't generalize; generalizations are generally wrong. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
When an interface undertakes to do too much its implementation will probably be large, slow and complicated. An interface is a contract to deliver a certain amount of service; clients of the interface depend on the contract, which is usually documented in the interface specification. They also depend on incurring a reasonable cost (in time or other scarce resources) for using the interface; the definition of 'reasonable' is usually not documented anywhere. If there are six levels of abstraction, and each costs 50% more than is 'reasonable', the service delivered at the top will miss by more than a factor of 10. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Service must have a fairly predictable cost, and the interface must not promise more than the implementer knows how to deliver. Especially, it should not promise features needed by only a few clients, unless the implementer knows how to provide them without penalizing others. A better implementer, or one who comes along ten years later when the problem is better understood, might be able to deliver, but unless the one you have can do so, it is wise to reduce your aspirations. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
If in doubt, leave it out.
%
Exterminate features. - Charles P. Thacker
%
Perfection must be reached by degrees; she requires the slow hand of time. - Voltaire
%
Keep secrets of the implementation. Secrets are assumptions about an implementation that client programs are not allowed to make. In other words, they are things that can change; the interface defines the things that cannot change (without simultaneous changes to both implementation and client). Obviously, it is easier to program and modify a system if its parts make fewer assumptions about each other. On the other hand, the system may not be easier to design - it's hard to design a good interface. And there is a tension with the desire not to hide power. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
One way to improve performance is to increase the number of assumptions that one part of a system makes about another; the additional assumptions often allow less work to be done, sometimes a lot less. For instance, if a set of size n is known to be sorted, a membership test takes time log n rather than n. This technique is very important in the design of algorithms and the tuning of small modules. In a large system the ability to improve each part separately is usually more important. Striking the right balance remains an art. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Divide and conquer. A well known method for solving a hard problem: reduce it to several easier ones. The resulting program is usually recursive. When resources are limited the method takes a slightly different form: bite off as much as will fit, leaving the rest for another iteration. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
An efficient program is an exercise in logical brinkmanship. - Edsger Dijkstra
%
Use a good idea again instead of generalizing it. A specialized implementation of the idea may be much more effective than a general one. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Handle normal and worst cases separately, because the requirements for the two are quite different: The normal case must be fast. The worst case must make some progress. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Nearly every non-trivial system has more specialized applications of caching. This is especially true for interactive or real-time systems, in which the basic problem is to incrementally update a complex state in response to frequent small changes. Doing this in an ad-hoc way is extremely error-prone. The best organizing principle is to recompute the entire state after each change but cache all the expensive results of this computation. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Compute in background when possible. In an interactive or real-time system, it is good to do as little work as possible before responding to a request. The reason is twofold: first, a rapid response is better for the users, and second, the load usually varies a great deal, so there is likely to be idle processor time later in which to do background work. Many kinds of work can be deferred to background. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)

Be wary then; best safety lies in fear. - William Shakespeare, 'Hamlet', Polonius' advice to Laertes (~1600)

%
Safety first. In allocating resources, strive to avoid disaster rather than to attain an optimum. Many years of experience with virtual memory, networks, disk allocation, database layout, and other resource allocation problems has made it clear that a general-purpose system cannot optimize the use of resources. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Shed load to control demand, rather than allowing the system to become overloaded. There are many ways to shed load. An interactive system can refuse new users, or even deny service to existing ones. A memory manager can limit the jobs being served so that all their working sets fit in the available memory. A network can discard packets. If it comes to the worst, the system can crash and start over more prudently. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)

Creative, interactive communication requires a plastic or moldable medium that can be modeled, a dynamic medium in which premises will flow into consequences, and above all a common medium that can be contributed to and experimented with by all. - J.C.R. Licklider and R. W. Taylor (1968)
%
By far the most numerous, most sophisticated, and most important models are those that reside in men's minds. In richness, plasticity, facility, and economy, the mental model has no peer, but, in other respects, it has short-comings. It will not stand still for careful study. It cannot be made to repeat a run. No one knows just how it works. It serves its owner's hopes more faithfully than it serves reason. It has access only to the information stored in one man's head. It can be observed and manipulated only by one person. Society rightly distrusts the modeling done by a single mind. Society demands consensus, agreement, at least majority. Fundamentally, this amounts to the requirement that individual models be compared and brought into some degree of accord. The requirement is for communication, which we now define concisely as 'cooperative modeling' - cooperation in the construction, maintenance, and use of a model. - J.C.R. Licklider and R. W.

%
Complexity is the state where questions are solvable binarily only if submitting to dogma. - Etienne Klein (2018)

The most robust programs isolate complexity in a way that lets significant parts of the system appear simple and straightforward and interact in simple ways with other components in the system. - Terry Crowley
%
Performance analysis plays a key part in determining how and where to hide complexity. - Terry Crowley
%
Success in hiding complexity is determined not by the component doing the hiding but by the consumers of that component. - Terry Crowley
%
It is the fundamental role of a system designer to determine how to break down a system into components and layers; to make decisions about what to build and what to pick up from elsewhere. An important element in large scale engineering is understanding how these decisions will play out over time. Change fundamentally underlies everything we do as programmers, so these design choices are not only evaluated in the moment, but are evaluated in the years to come as the product continues to evolve. - Terry Crowley
%
Layers (or abstractions) are fundamentally leaky. These leaks have consequences immediately but also have consequences over time, in two ways. One consequence is that the characteristics of the layer leak through and permeate more of the system than you realize. These might be assumptions about specific performance characteristics or behavior ordering that is not an explicit part of the layer contract. This means that you generally are more vulnerable to changes in the internal behavior of the component that you understood. A second consequence is it also means you are more dependent on that internal behavior than is obvious, so if you consider changing that layer the consequences and challenges are probably larger than you thought. - Terry Crowley
%
Layers are too functional. A component you adopt will have more functionality than you actually require. In some cases, the decision to use it is based on leveraging that functionality for future uses. You adopt specifically because you want to 'get on the train' and leverage the ongoing work that will go into that component. Consequences: 1) The component will often make trade-offs that are biased by functionality that you do not actually require. 2) The component will embed complexity and constraints because of functionality you do not require and those constraints will impede future evolution of that component. 3) There will be more surface area to leak into your application. Some of that leakage will be due to true 'leaky abstractions' and some will be explicit (but generally poorly controlled) increased dependence on the full capabilities of the component. - Terry Crowley
%
Layers get replaced. Requirements evolve, systems evolve, components are abandoned. You eventually need to replace that layer or component. This is true for external component dependencies as well as internal ones. - Terry Crowley
%
Break apart and simplify components rather than accrete more and more functionality within them. - Terry Crowley
%
Revel in the asynchrony. Rather than trying to hide it, you accept it and design for it. - Terry Crowley
%
When you see a technique like idempotency or immutability, you recognize them as ways of embracing the fundamental nature of the universe, not just one more design tool in your toolbox. - Terry Crowley
%
Much of performance analysis is about three things: locality, locality, locality. Whether it is packing data on disk, managing processor cache hierarchies, or coalescing data into a communications packet, how data is packed together, the patterns for how you touch that data with locality over time and the patterns of how you transfer that data between components is fundamental to performance. Focusing on less code operating on less data with more locality over space and time is a good way to cut through the noise. - Terry Crowley
%
When looking at the structure of a system, I'm less interested in seeing how the code interacts... I want to see how the data interacts and flows. - Terry Crowley
%
If someone tries to explain a system by describing the code structure and does not understand the rate and volume of data flow, they do not understand the system. - Terry Crowley
%
Caches are fundamental but also dangerous. Caches are trying to leverage the runtime behavior of the code to change the pattern of interaction between different components in the system. They inherently need to model that behavior, even if that model is implicit in how they fill and invalidate the cache and test for a cache hit. If the model is poor or becomes poor as the behavior changes, the cache will not operate as expected. A simple guideline is that caches must be instrumented - their behavior will degrade over time because of changing behavior of the application and the changing nature and balance of the performance characteristics of the components you are modeling. Every long-time programmer has cache horror stories. - Terry Crowley
%
Light speed analysis: What is the best theoretical performance I could achieve with this design? What is the real information content being transferred and at what rate of change? What is the underlying latency and bandwidth between components? Could the approach ever achieve the performance goals or does it need a rethink? Understand the true performance characteristics of your building blocks rather than focusing on functional characteristics. - Terry Crowley
%
The human visual and nervous system [is] inherently constrained, which means a system designer can leverage (must leverage) those constraints, e.g. by virtualization (limiting how much of the underlying data model needs to be mapped into view data structures) or by limiting the rate of screen update to the perception limits of the human visual system. - Terry Crowley
%
I have struggled with complexity my entire career. One of our key approaches for managing complexity is to 'walk away' and start fresh. Often new tools or languages force us to start from scratch which means that developers end up conflating the benefits of the tool with the benefits of the clean start. The clean start is what is fundamental. The simplest way of controlling complexity growth is to build a smaller system with fewer developers. - Terry Crowley
%
I used to say my job was to design feedback loops. Transparent processes [are] a great tool for empowerment - the manager can invest more and more local control in those closest to the problem because of confidence they have visibility to the progress being made. Coordination emerges naturally. Key to this is that the goal has actually been properly framed (including key resource constraints like ship schedule). Decision-making that needs to constantly flow up and down the management chain usually reflects poor framing of goals and constraints by management. - Terry Crowley on technical management
%
One dirty little secret you learn as you move up the management ladder is that you and your new peers aren't suddenly smarter because you now have more responsibility. This reinforces that the organization as a whole better be smarter than the leader at the top. Empowering every level to own their decisions within a consistent framing is the key approach to making this true. Listening and making yourself accountable to the organization for articulating and explaining the reasoning behind your decisions is another key strategy. Surprisingly, fear of making a dumb decision can be a useful motivator for ensuring you articulate your reasoning clearly and make sure you listen to all inputs. - Terry Crowley on technical management
%
Crowley's 1st rule of distributed systems design: Think through the implications to the user experience from the start rather than trying to patch on error handling, cancellation and status reporting as an afterthought.
%
Crowley's 2nd rule of distributed systems design: Use asynchronous techniques to couple components. Synchronous coupling is impossible. If something appears synchronous, it's because some internal layer has tried to hide the asynchrony and in doing so has obscured (but definitely not hidden) a fundamental characteristic of the runtime behavior of the system.
%
Crowley's 3rd rule of distributed systems design: Recognize and explicitly design for interacting state machines. These states represent robust long-lived internal system states (rather than ad-hoc, ephemeral and undiscoverable state encoded by the value of variables in a deep call stack).
%
Crowley's 4th rule of distributed systems design: Failure is expected. The only guaranteed way to detect failure in a distributed system is to simply decide you have waited 'too long'. This naturally means that cancellation is first-class. Some layer of the system (perhaps plumbed through to the user) will need to decide it has waited too long and cancel the interaction. Cancelling is only about reestablishing local state and reclaiming local resources - there is no way to reliably propagate that cancellation through the system. It can sometimes be useful to have a low-cost, unreliable way to attempt to propagate cancellation as a performance optimization.
%
Crowley's 5th rule of distributed systems design: Cancellation is not rollback since it is just reclaiming local resources and state. If rollback is necessary, it needs to be an end-to-end feature.
%
Crowley's 6th rule of distributed systems design: You can never really know the state of a distributed component. As soon as you discover the state, it may have changed. When you send an operation, it may be lost in transit, it might be processed but the response is lost, or it may take some significant amount of time to process so the remote state ultimately transitions at some arbitrary time in the future. This leads to approaches like idempotent operations and the ability to robustly and efficiently rediscover remote state rather than expecting that distributed components can reliably track state in parallel. The concept of 'eventual consistency' succinctly captures many of these ideas.

A distributed system is one where the failure of a machine you've never heard of stops you from getting any work done. - Leslie Lamport
%
Success really depends on the conception of the problem, the design of the system, not in the details of how it's coded. - Leslie Lamport
%
You're not going to come up with a simple design through any kind of coding techniques or any kind of programming language concepts. Simplicity has to be achieved above the code level before you get to the point which you worry about how you actually implement this thing in code. - Leslie Lamport
%
UML - I know next to nothing about UML - but what I do know is the language was invented first and then people came around and tried to give semantics to the language. Well, in other words what that means is that the language was invented first and it really didn't mean anything. And then, later on, people came around to try to figure out what it meant. Well, that's not the way to design a specification language. The importance of a specification language is to specify something precisely, and therefore what you write - the specification you write - has to have a precise, rigorous meaning. - Leslie Lamport
%
UML: a language that was invented first and then people came around to try to get semantics. - Leslie Lamport
%
UML: fuzzy pictures of boxes and arrows. - Leslie Lamport
%
People use UML, things like UML, to model programs, but it's not clear how to translate them in to sequences of states, for concurrency. If you cannot translate them in to sequences of states, it means you don't understand them, and it may mean that there's nothing there. You know, there are lots of people selling snake-oil, drawing boxes and arrows that make you feel good, but ultimately have no real meaning. If something is really meaningful you should be able to express it in mathematics. - Leslie Lamport
%
The benefit of using [a formal specification language] is that it teaches you to think rigorously, to think precisely, and the important point is the precise thinking. So what you need to avoid at all costs is any language that's all syntax and no semantics. - Leslie Lamport
%
A lot of the problems that exist in software, a lot of the problems that one encounters in writing... in building a system, in writing a program: those are problems that are caused by not thinking about what you are doing before starting to code. - Leslie Lamport
%
If you're building a complicated system, the battle is won or lost before a single piece of code is written. - Leslie Lamport
%
You're not going to find the best algorithm in terms of computational complexity by coding. - Leslie Lamport
%
You could decide that you want to do something - the what - and then when it comes to programming it you discover that you can't - that is, you don't know how or the how is too expensive or something like that. So I don't mean to imply that what you should first do is thinking completely abstractly about what something is supposed to do and then, only then do you think about how you do it. Part of engineering is understanding what you can do in practice and what you can't. But, given that caveat, you really should understand what the system is doing before you try to implement it. - Leslie Lamport
%
There are two separate things you want to specify about a program or a system: what it does, and how it should do it. - Leslie Lamport
%
It's really important to understand what something is supposed to do before you start to do it. Very often, once you've decided precisely what something is supposed to do, implementing it - the coding, the how - is quite trivial, and it hardly needs a specification at all or might be so simple that you really can just start coding without writing any precise description of how it does it, beyond the specification of what it's supposed to do. - Leslie Lamport
%
First of all, there are lots of different things that can go by the name of specification. I use all of them. Sometimes a specification I write is a few English sentences. Sometimes, it's a very complicated mathematical description of the object, the what or the how. Which one is appropriate depends on the problem: how hard the problem is, how important it is that it get done correctly, and various things like that. - Leslie Lamport
%
Anything you do is an iterative process. You start out by thinking about something, and then you start writing it, and in the course of writing it, you rewrite and you rewrite and you rewrite. - Leslie Lamport
%
A lot of programs I write just for my own use and I can live with the bugs and it's not that important that they be absolutely correct, but sometimes I write code for other people to use and I really want it to work right. - Leslie Lamport
%
The important thing is not the syntax of what you're writing: the important thing is the precision, the rigor. In order to understand things, you have to write them precisely. I use mathematics because that is precise. - Leslie Lamport
%
People who are programmers should be able to think precisely. - Leslie Lamport
%
What you need to avoid at all costs is any language that's all syntax and no semantics, because that is not going to get you to think rigorously - that's going to get you to fool yourself in to thinking that you're thinking. - Leslie Lamport
%
My basic mode of thinking hasn't changed: basically the idea that I want to understand things, and understand things for me means being able to describe them mathematically. - Leslie Lamport
%
To think, you have to write. If you're thinking without writing, you only think you're thinking. - Leslie Lamport
%
Writing requires thinking. - Leslie Lamport
%
There are two models of reality that I find to be the most useful ones, especially when writing programs. The first is functions, and the second is sequences of states. - Leslie Lamport
%
All possible successor states of any state. - Leslie Lamport
%
Not knowing what a program should do means we have to think even harder, before we start coding. - Leslie Lamport
%
You write a spec to help you think about a problem before you write the code. - Leslie Lamport
%
People are so used to thinking at a code level that they can't think at a higher level. - Leslie Lamport
%
Why don't programmers write specs? Writing is like running. The less you do it, the slower you are. You have to strengthen your writing muscles. It takes practice. It's easier to find an excuse not to. - Leslie Lamport
%
Thinking doesn't guarantee that you won't make mistakes. Not thinking guarantees that you will. - Leslie Lamport
%
The right way to think about distributed systems, and I've been doing it for 40 years, is in terms of the state of the system. - Leslie Lamport
%
To the extent that [Agile software development] is [an excuse for not thinking], it's a bad thing. - Leslie Lamport
%
The essence of computing is discreteness, and I believe that what one will discover is that the essence of perception is discretizing something. That is, perception means receiving this continuous input from the environment and making a discrete categorization of it, and that's the point at which perception happens. - Leslie Lamport
%
Generally it doesn't seem to be necessary to deal with Byzantine failures. Using simple techniques like checksums to avoid corruption of data, it's generally felt that that kind of malicious behavior, outside of - where the malice is caused by failure not by hackers - you don't need Byzantine fault tolerance. So, in practice that means if the computers that you're building your system out of are under your control and not under hackers' control then you don't need Byzantine fault tolerance, in which case Paxos is basically the algorithm you should be using. There are different consensus algorithms that have been proposed but the ones that are practical in the sense that they're efficient are all equivalent to Paxos at least in the normal case, and Paxos works: use that. I mean it doesn't solve all your problems, because you still have the problem of optimizing: there are lots of optimization games you can play depending upon the particular nature of the state machine you're trying to implement, but if you understand the basic Paxos algorithm then you'll understand what optimizations can be made to get it to work well for your system. - Leslie Lamport
%
If you're not writing a program, you shouldn't use a programming language, because programming languages are really complicated. They get more and more complicated. Now, they're complicated for good reason: they've got a difficult problem to solve, which is to be able to generate efficient code for these complicated machines, but there's a lot simpler way to describe systems, algorithms, whatever, and y'know it's a language that's been developed for a couple of thousand years for saying things precisely. It's mathematics. - Leslie Lamport
%
Computation is not just about functions. If computation were about functions then quicksort and bubble-sort were the same because they're computing the same function. As I said a computing device is something that goes through a sequence of states and what an assignment statement is doing is it is telling you here is a new state, and also there's the notion of its non-determinism, so the new state is not a function of the old state. So functional programming in a sense - functions - don't solve the problem of programming. - Leslie Lamport
%
The mathematics of computing - things like sets and functions and logic - are to computing what real numbers are to physics. People who are writing programs should be as facile with that kind of very simple math as physicists are with numbers. - Leslie Lamport
%
When you understand something, then you can find the math to express that understanding. The math doesn't provide the understanding. - Leslie Lamport

The way control emerges in a quantum-mechanical sense is in the manipulation of guard-rails or constraining walls, forces called potentials: containers that limit the probable range of electrons to an approximately predictable region.

The simplest idea of stability is constancy, or invariance. A thing that has no possibility to change is, by definition, immune to external perturbations.

When one looks in more detail, we find that we may only have invariance of an average. - Mark Burgess, In Search of Certainty: The Science of Our Information Infrastructure (2013)

The fact that something is silly doesn't mean that it should be ignored. Hitler was silly. The Inquisition was stupid. The great religious wars and persecutions, I would argue, were thoroughly absurd. But they were also very terrible. The beliefs themselves may be silly or harmless, but a resurgence of medieval-type thinking is no laughing matter. - Robert Burnham Jr., Astronomer (1983)

We are all children. But if we cannot be wise, we can at least be honest. I accept the existence of what I call the all-pervading intelligence of the universe. The Orientals call it the Tao. To me, that is too obvious to need scientific proof. That's my religion - that and the Grand Canyon. And Yosemite. And the surf coming in with the tide. And NGC-6611. - Robert Burnham Jr., Astronomer (1983)

I would say this: There is no ultimate truth about life or the universe which can be expressed in words. Whatever it is, it has to be experienced directly. Words are symbols, never to be confused with the thing itself. The most that any set of symbols can do is to point the way. Your task is to walk down the road, not to worship the signpost. - Robert Burnham Jr., Astronomer (1983)

What can we do as a profession? First of all, acknowledge that our view of the benefits of finance is inflated. While there is no doubt that a developed economy needs a sophisticated financial sector, at the current state of knowledge there is no theoretical reason or empirical evidence to support the notion that all the growth of the financial sector in the last forty years has been beneficial to society. In fact, we have both theoretical reasons and empirical evidence to claim that a component has been pure rent seeking. By defending all forms of finance, by being unwilling to separate the wheat from the chaff, we have lost credibility in defending the real contribution of finance. - Luigi Zingales, 'Does Finance Benefit Society?' 2015 American Finance Association Presidential Address.

All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilised nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in intellectual production. The intellectual creations of individual nations become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises a world literature. - 'The Communist Manifesto', Karl Marx and Frederick Engels (1848)

We use administrative data at the U.S. Census Bureau to study the ages of founders of growth-oriented start-ups in the past decade. Our primary finding is that successful entrepreneurs are middle-aged, not young. The mean founder age for the 1 in 1,000 fastest growing new ventures is 45.0. The findings are broadly similar when considering high-technology sectors, entrepreneurial hubs, and successful firm exits. Prior experience in the specific industry predicts much greater rates of entrepreneurial success.

We must do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian-Darwinian theory, he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living. - Buckminster Fuller, 'New York Magazine' (1970)

It is an unfortunate fact that the bulk of humanity is too limited in its mental vision to weigh with patience and intelligence those isolated phenomena, seen and felt only by a psychologically sensitive few, which lie outside its common experience. Men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and the unreal; that all things appear as they do only by virtue of the delicate individual physical and metntal media through which we are made conscious of them; but the prosaic materialism of the majority condemns as madness the flashes of super-sight which penetrate the common veil of obvious empiricism. - H.

We went through that stage at Apple where we went out and we thought "Oh, we're gonna be a big company, let's hire professional management." We went out and hired a bunch of professional management - it didn't work at all. Most of them were bozos. They knew how to manage, but they didn't know how to do anything! And so, if you're a great person why do you want to work for somebody you can't learn anything from? And you know what's interesting, you know who the best managers are? They're the great individual contributors, who never ever want to be a manager, but decide they have to be a manager because no one else is going to be able to do as good a job as them. - Steve Jobs

Assange published proof of systematic torture. But instead of those responsible for the torture, it is Assange who is being persecuted. Second, he himself has been ill-treated to the point that he is now exhibiting symptoms of psychological torture. And third, he is to be extradited to a country that holds people like him in prison conditions that Amnesty International has described as torture. In summary: Julian Assange uncovered torture, has been tortured himself and could be tortured to death in the United States. And a case like that isn't supposed to be part of my area of responsibility? Beyond that, the case is of symbolic importance and affects every citizen of a democratic country. - Nils Melzer, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture

There must be no barriers to freedom of inquiry ... there is no place for dogma in science. The scientist is free, and must be free to ask any question, to doubt any assertion, to seek for any evidence, to correct any errors. Our political life is also predicated on openness. We know that the only way to avoid error is to detect it and that the only way to detect it is to be free to inquire. And we know that as long as men are free to ask what they must, free to say what they think, free to think what they will, freedom can never be lost, and science can never regress. - J.

Among the innumerable mortifications which waylay human arrogance on every side may well be reckoned our ignorance of the most common objects and effects, a defect of which we become more sensible by every attempt to supply it. Vulgar and inactive minds confound familiarity with knowledge and conceive themselves informed of the whole nature of things when they are shown their form or told their use; but the speculatist, who is not content with superficial views, harasses himself with fruitless curiosity, and still, as he inquires more, perceives only that he knows less. - Samuel Johnson, 'The Idler' (1758-11-25)

Originality is their currency and constant adaptation their tool. - David McWilliams

Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers. The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present - and is gravely to be regarded. Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite. - Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1961-01-17 farewell address warning of the military industrial complex

The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance, I think. When a scientist doesn’t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty darn sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt. We have found it of paramount importance that in order to progress we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Scientific knowledge is a body of statements of varying degrees of certainty – some most unsure, some nearly sure, but none absolutely certain. Now, we scientists are used to this, and we take it for granted that it is perfectly consistent to be unsure, that it is possible to live and not know. But I don't know whether everyone realizes this is true. Our freedom to doubt was born out of a struggle against authority in the early days of science. It was a very deep and strong struggle: permit us to question – to doubt – to not be sure. I think that it is important that we do not forget this struggle and thus perhaps lose what we have gained. - Richard Feynman

When I start to investigate some topic, during the first days I fill up scratch paper like mad. I mean, I have a huge pile of paper at home, paper that's half-used, used on only one side; I've kept a lot of partially printed sheets instead of throwing them away, so that I can write on the back sides. And I'll use up 20 sheets or more per hour when I'm exploring a problem, especially at the beginning. For the first hour I'm trying all kinds of stuff and looking for patterns. Later, after internalizing those calculations or drawings or whatever they are, I don't have to write quite so much down, and I'm getting closer to a solution. The best test of when I'm about ready to solve a problem is whether or not I can think about it sensibly while swimming, without any paper or notes to help out. Because my mind is getting accustomed to the territory, and finally I can see what might possibly lead to the end. - Donald Knuth

It's extremely misleading to rank people on an IQ scale with the idea that the smarter they are, the more suitable they are for a PhD degree; that's not it at all.

Creative destruction occurs despite our best efforts to stamp it out.

Near-optimal robustness in both natural and economic systems is not achieved with simplistically diverse agent compositions or with significant redundancies or slack at agent level. - Ashwin Parameswaran (2012)

The key to achieving resilience with near-optimal configurations is to tackle disturbances and generate novelty/innovation with an an emergent systemic response that reconfigures the system rather than simply a localised response. - Ashwin Parameswaran (2012)
%
Eventually mean/median system performance deteriorates as more and more pure slack and redundancy needs to be built in at all levels to make up for the irreversibly fragile nature of the system. The business cycle is an oscillation between efficient fragility and robust inefficiency. Over the course of successive cycles, both poles of this oscillation get worse which leads to median/mean system performance falling rapidly at the same time that the tails deteriorate due to the increased illegibility of the automated system to the human operator. - Ashwin Parameswaran (2012)

Complex systems are intrinsically hazardous systems. - Richard I. Cook, MD. 'How Complex Systems Fail'.

Complex systems are heavily and successfully defended against failure. The high consequences of failure lead over time to the construction of multiple layers of defense against failure.

CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem): it is impossible for a distributed computer system to simultaneously provide Consistency (all nodes see the same data at the same time), Availability (a guarantee that every request receives a response about whether it was successful or failed) and Partition tolerance (the system continues to operate despite arbitrary message loss or failure of part of the system) - Eric Brewer, Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC) (2000)
%
CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem) - Clarification 1: Because Partitions are rare, there is little reason to forfeit Consistency or Availability when the system is not partitioned. - Eric Brewer, IEEE Computer Society 'Computer' Magazine (2012)
%
CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem) - Clarification 2: The choice between Consistency and Availability can occur many times within the same system at very fine granularity; not only can subsystems make different choices, but the choice can change according to the operation or even the specific data or user involved. - Eric Brewer, IEEE Computer Society 'Computer' Magazine (2012)
%
CAP Theorem (Brewer's Theorem) - Clarification 3: All three properties (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) are more continuous than binary. Availability is obviously continuous from 0 to 100 percent, but there are also many levels of Consistency, and even Partitions have nuances, including disagreement within the system about whether a Partition exists. - Eric Brewer, IEEE Computer Society 'Computer' Magazine (2012)

Lampson's Law: Get it right. Neither abstraction nor simplicity is a substitute for getting it right. In fact, abstraction can be a source of severe difficulties. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Lampson's Law - Corollary of Speed: Make it fast, rather than general or powerful. If it's fast, the client can program the function it wants, and another client can program some other function. It is much better to have basic operations executed quickly than more powerful ones that are slower (of course, a fast, powerful operation is best, if you know how to get it). The trouble with slow, powerful operations is that the client who doesn’t want the power pays more for the basic function. Usually it turns out that the powerful operation is not the right one. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Lampson's Law - Corollary of Power: Don't hide power. When a low level of abstraction allows something to be done quickly, higher levels should not bury this power inside something more general. The purpose of abstractions is to conceal undesirable properties; desirable ones should not be hidden. Sometimes, of course, an abstraction is multiplexing a resource, and this necessarily has some cost. But it should be possible to deliver all or nearly all of it to a single client with only slight loss of performance. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Lampson's Law - Corollary of Arguments: Use procedure arguments to provide flexibility in an interface. They can be restricted or encoded in various ways if necessary for protection or portability. This technique can greatly simplify an interface, eliminating a jumble of parameters that amount to a small programming language. A simple example is an enumeration procedure that returns all the elements of a set satisfying some property. The cleanest interface allows the client to pass a filter procedure that tests for the property, rather than defining a special language of patterns or whatever. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Lampson's Law - Corollary of the Client: Leave it to the client. As long as it is cheap to pass control back and forth, an interface can combine simplicity, flexibility and high performance by solving only one problem and leaving the rest to the client. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)

It used to be the case that people were admonished to "not re-invent the wheel". We now live in an age that spends a lot of time "reinventing the flat tire!" The flat tires come from the reinventors often not being in the same league as the original inventors. This is a symptom of a "pop culture" where identity and participation are much more important than progress... - Alan Kay (2016)

In the US we are now embedded in a pop culture that has progressed far enough to seriously hurt places that hold "developed cultures".

Better and Perfect are the enemies of What-Is-Actually-Needed: The big sin so many people commit in computing is not really paying attention to "What-Is-Actually-Needed"! And not going below that.

You could 'hot-edit' Lisp (1.85 at BBN) in the 60s (and there were other such systems). Smalltalk at Parc in the 70s used many of these ideas, and went even further. Development environments should help programmers think (but what if most programmers don't want to think?) - Alan Kay (2016)

When the first Turing Award winner - Al Perlis - was asked in the 60s "What is Computer Science?", he said "It is the science of processes!". He meant all processes including those on computers, but also in Biology, society, etc. His idea was that computing formed a wonderful facility for making better models of pretty much everything, especially dynamic things (which everything actually is), and that it was also the kind of thing that could really be understood much better by using it to make models of itself. Today, we could still take this as a starting place for "getting 'Computer Science' back from where it was banished". - Alan Kay (2016)

The question you are asking is really a societal one - and about operations that are like strip mining and waste dumping. "Hunters and gatherers" (our genetic heritage) find fertile valleys, strip them dry and move on (this only works on a very small scale). "Civilization" is partly about learning how to overcome our dangerous atavistic tendencies through education and planning. It's what we should be about generally (and the CS part of it is just a symptom of a much larger much more dire situation we are in). - Alan Kay (2016)

 One of several major mistakes with the web has to do with thinking that the browser is some kind of application "with features" - if you think of the actual scale of the Internet (and they didn't) you realize that at the very least, the browser, etc, has to be more like an operating system, and with as few features as possible: really to safely run encapsulated modules and deal out resources. It is crazy that after more than 20 years of the web that this CS101 principle still can't be done ... and it runs on machines that can do it.... - Alan Kay (2016)

Advice to CS students: Learn a lot of other things, and at least one real science and one real engineering. This will help to calibrate the somewhat odd lore aka "computing knowledge".

There's coming up with ideas: learn to dream while you are awake, the ideas are there. There's coming up with a good idea: learn how to not get buried in your ideas (most are mediocre down to bad even for people who have "good idea skills"!) I write down ideas in notebooks to get rid of them. Every once in a while one will capture a different point of view. And, there's the Princeton Tea joke of scientists comparing what they did for ideas. One says "I have them in the middle of the night so I have a pad by my bed". Another says "I have them in the shower so I have a grease pencil to write them on the walls". Einstein was listening and they asked him about his ideas. He said "I don't know, I've only had two!"

Most of my ideas come in "waking dreams" (this is a state that most children indulge in readily, but it can be retained in a more or less useful way - I don't think you quite get into adulthood by retaining it, so it's a tradeoff).

The problems with most arguments is that they arguers assume they are in a valid context (this is usually not the case, and this is the central problem of "being rational").

A good heuristic for designing programming languages is to try to take the largest most complicated kinds of things you want to do, work them out, and then see if there is a "language lurking". Most people make the big mistake of lovingly making small neat examples that are easy to learn - these often don't scale at all well. E.g. "data" in the small "seems natural" but the whole idea scales terribly. And so forth for most of the favorite paradigms around today. - Alan Kay (2016)

Try to avoid "growing old"! A big problem with the general industry is the lack of subsidized "sabbatical years" - these are a good way to recharge and re-orient.

Keep basic interfaces stable. Since an interface embodies assumptions that are shared by more than one part of a system, and sometimes by a great many parts, it is very desirable not to change the interface. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)
%
Keep a place to stand if you do have to change interfaces. One is the compatibility package, which implements an old interface on top of a new system. This allows programs that depend on the old interface to continue working. Many new operating systems have kept old software usable by simulating the supervisor calls of an old system. Usually these simulators need only a small amount of effort compared to the cost of reimplementing the old software, and it is not hard to get acceptable performance. At a different level, the IBM 360/370 systems provided emulation of the instruction sets of older machines like the 1401 and 7090. Taken a little further, this leads to virtual machines, which simulate (several copies of) a machine on the machine itself. - Butler W. Lampson (1983)

All inventions have their origin either in the desire to get something new, or in the desire to get something more cheaply.

Thomas Edison was already famous for his telegraph technology and his huge hit with the record player. He had made a public show of turning the full focus of his massive laboratory to the question of electric light. A couple of years into the effort a reporter was visiting his lab and asked how close Edison was to coming up with a viable light bulb. Edison replied "We are on bulb number 732!"

There was a romantic tradition, in this country at least, of the drifter Typesetters, who were good enough at the craft to find work wherever they traveled. They'd work in one town until they wanted a change and then drift on.

We are at the end of a five-thousand-year-plus historical process during which human society grew in scale while it abandoned the early indigenous wisdom councils and communal decision-making. Power was centralised in the hands of increasingly specialised 'elites' and 'experts' who not only failed to achieve all they promised but used secrecy and the control of information to deceive the public into allowing them to retain power over community resources that they ultimately looted. - Robert David Steele, 'The Open-source Everything Manifesto'

The preconditions of revolution exist in the UK, and most western countries. The number of active pre-conditions is quite stunning, from elite isolation to concentrated wealth to inadequate socialisation and education, to concentrated land holdings to loss of authority to repression of new technologies especially in relation to energy, to the atrophy of the public sector and spread of corruption, to media dishonesty, to mass unemployment of young men and on and on and on. [...] Preconditions are not the same as precipitants. We are waiting for our Tunisian fruit seller. The public will endure great repression, especially when most media outlets and schools are actively aiding the repressive meme of 'you are helpless, this is the order of things.' When we have a scandal so powerful that it cannot be ignored by the average Briton or American, we will have a revolution that overturns the corrupt political systems in both countries, and perhaps puts many banks out of business. Vaclav Havel calls this 'The Power of the Powerless.' One spark, one massive fire. - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19
%
The west has pursued an industrialisation path that allows for the privatisation of wealth from the commons, along with the criminalisation of commons rights of the public, as well as the externalisation of all true costs. Never mind that fracking produces earthquakes and poisons aquifers – corrupt politicians at local, state or province, and national levels are all too happy to take money for looking the other way. Our entire commercial, diplomatic, and informational systems are now cancerous. - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19

When trade treaties have secret sections - or are entirely secret - one can be certain the public is being screwed and the secrecy is an attempt to avoid accountability. Secrecy enables corruption. So also does an inattentive public enable corruption. - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19
%
Predatory capitalism is based on the privatisation of profit and the externalisation of cost. It is an extension of the fencing of the commons, of enclosures, along with the criminalisation of prior common customs and rights. What we need is a system that fully accounts for all costs. Whether we call that capitalism or not is irrelevant to me. But doing so would fundamentally transform the dynamic of present day capitalism, by making capital open source. - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19

We have over 5 billion human brains that are the one infinite resource available to us going forward. Crowd-sourcing and cognitive surplus are two terms of art for the changing power dynamic between those at the top that are ignorant and corrupt, and those across the bottom that are attentive and ethical. The open source ecology is made up of a wide range of opens – open farm technology, open source software, open hardware, open networks, open money, open small business technology, open patents – to name just a few. The key point is that they must all develop together, otherwise the existing system will isolate them into ineffectiveness. - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19

The National Security Agency (NSA) has not prevented any terrorist incidents. CIA cannot even get the population of Syria correct and provides no intelligence - decision-support - to most cabinet secretaries, assistant secretaries, and department heads.

Open source everything is about the five billion poor coming together to reclaim their collective wealth and mobilise it to transform their lives. There is zero chance of the revolution being put down. Public agency is emergent, and the ability of the public to literally put any bank or corporation out of business overnight is looming. To paraphrase Abe Lincoln, you cannot screw all of the people all of the time. We're there. All we lack is a major precipitant – our Tunisian fruit seller. When it happens the revolution will be deep and lasting. - Robert David Steele, ex-Marine, ex-CIA, Open Source Intelligence Expert in The Guardian, 2014-06-19

Top down power has failed in a most spectacular manner, and bottom-up consensus power is emergent. "Not in my neighborhood" is beginning to trump "Because I say so." - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19

The one unlimited resource we have on the planet is the human brain – the current strategy of 1% capitalism is failing because it is killing the Golden Goose at multiple levels. Unfortunately, the gap between those with money and power and those who actually know what they are talking about has grown catastrophic. The rich are surrounded by sycophants and pretenders whose continued employment demands that they not question the premises. As Larry Summers lectured Elizabeth Warren, 'insiders do not criticise insiders.' - Robert David Steele, The Guardian, 2014-06-19

The national security state works for the City of London and Wall Street – both are about to be toppled by a combination of Eastern alternative banking and alternative international development capabilities, and individuals who recognise that they have the power to pull their money out of the banks and not buy the consumer goods that subsidise corruption and the concentration of wealth.

The goal is to reject money and concentrated, illicitly aggregated and largely phantom wealth in favor of community wealth defined by community knowledge, community sharing of information, and community definition of truth derived in transparency and authenticity, the latter being the ultimate arbiter of shared wealth. - Robert David Steele, 'The Open-source Everything Manifesto'

It is our obligation to speak of what we know as we know it, not dissembling or deceiving. This could be considered the 'moral truth', and ultimately it is what can be validated by others so that a consensus can be arrived at and shared. - Robert David Steele, 'The Open-source Everything Manifesto'
%
Truth does change, both in the mind of man and in the larger reality where man resides. On the one hand, advancing knowledge and paradigm shifts can render old truths sadly insufficient, while bringing forward new, more robust truths. At the same time, actions taken by man while operating under old truths (for example, assuming that the Corps of Engineers can pave over the Mississippi wetlands and levee the largest river in the continental U.S. without having a Katrina-like consequence) create new truths - severe weather events that are not an Act of God but rather an Act of Man acting very badly over time and space. - Robert David Steele, 'The Open-source Everything Manifesto'

E Veritate Potens: From Truth, We (the People) Are Made Powerful - Winston Maike, Australian philosopher and researcher, as quoted by Robert David Steele, 'The Open-source Everything Manifesto'
%
Wealth creates a leisure class that 'buys' knowledge and defines irrational authority, thus destroying the ethical basis of civilization. Durant discussed how a civilization may be characterized by its conception of virtue, which led me to some fruitful exploration of how the United States is a culture that has equated wealth with virtue, leading to a political culture that can be bought because it is based on rule by secrecy, using secrecy to avoid accountability. Today, having abdicated concepts of the good, the beautiful, and the true for a model of primitive accumulation and a materialist set of values, we find that our financial system is what journalist Matt Taibbi called 'Griftopia'. The financial interests of Wall Street leverage the two-party system as a theatrical sideshow that legitimizes and legalizes massive fraud against the public interest. This is the primary reason why secrecy is necessary for those in power. - Robert David Steele, 'The Open-source Everything Manifesto'

Language, an internal system of the mind, is independent of externalization and basically provides expressions of linguistically formulated thought. As such, it is a system of pure structure, lacking linear order and other arrangements that are not really part of language as such but are imposed by requirements of the articulatory system (sign, which uses visual space, exploits some other options). Internal language is based on recursive operations that yield what we called the Basic Property of language: generation of an infinite array of hierarchically structured expressions that are interpreted as thoughts. The externalization system for language has no recursive operations - it is, basically, a deterministic mapping that introduces linear order and other arrangements that are required by the output system. - Noam Chomsky (2019)

Sin #1 - Unnecessary distributed parallelism: It does not always make sense to parallelize a computation. Doing so almost inevitably comes with an additional overhead, both in runtime performance and in engineering time. When designing a parallel implementation, its performance should always be compared to an optimized serial implementation in order to understand the overheads involved. If we satisfy ourselves that parallel processing is necessary, it is also worth considering whether distribution over multiple machines is required. The rapid increase in RAM and CPU cores can make local parallelism economical and worthwhile. Establish the need for distributed parallelism on a case by case basis. - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
%
Sin #2 - Assuming performance homogeneity: Virtualized cloud environments exhibit highly variable and sometimes unpredictable performance. Base reported results on multiple benchmark runs, and report the variance. - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
%
Sin #3 - Picking the low-hanging fruit: It is unsurprising that it is easy to beat a general system by specializing it. Few researchers comment on the composability of their solutions.  - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
%
Sin #4 - Forcing the abstraction: In some application domains, it is unclear if a MapReduce-like approach can offer any benefits, and indeed, some have argued that it is fruitless as a research direction. Ideally, future research should build on [iterative processing, stream processing and graph processing], rather than on the MapReduce paradigm. - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
%
Sin #5 - Unrepresentative workloads: The common assumption in academic research systems is that the cluster workload is relatively homogenous. Most research evaluations measure performance by running a single job on an otherwise idle cluster. - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
%
Sin #6 - Assuming perfect elasticity: The cloud paradigm [...] its promise of an unlimited supply of computation. This is, of course, a fallacy. Workloads do not exhibit infinite parallel speedup. The scalability and supply of compute resources are not infinite. There are limits to the scalability of data center communication infrastructure. Another reason for diminishing returns from parallelization is the increasing likelihood of failures and vulnerability to "straggler" tasks.  - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)
%
Sin #7 - Ignoring fault tolerance: Many recent systems neglect to account for the performance implications of fault tolerance, or indeed of faults occurring. For each system, we should ask whether fault tolerance is relevant or required. If it is, it makes sense to check precisely what level is required, and what faults are to be protected against; consider and ideally quantify the cost. - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)

Object-oriented programming is an exceptionally bad idea which could only have originated in California. - Edsger Dijkstra
%
Object-oriented design is the roman numerals of computing. - Rob Pike
%
The phrase 'object-oriented' means a lot of things. Half are obvious, and the other half are mistakes. - Paul Graham
%
Implementation inheritance causes the same intertwining and brittleness that have been observed when goto statements are overused. As a result, OO systems often suffer from complexity and lack of reuse. - John Ousterhout Scripting, IEEE Computer, March 1998
%
Sometimes, the elegant implementation is just a function. Not a method. Not a class. Not a framework. Just a function. - John Carmack
%
The problem with object-oriented languages is they've got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle. - Joe Armstrong
%
I used to be enamored of object-oriented programming. I'm now finding myself leaning toward believing that it is a plot designed to destroy joy. - Eric Allman
%
OO is the 'structured programming' snake oil of the 90's: useful at times, but hardly the 'end all' programing paradigm some like to make out of it. - Eric S. Raymond
%
Alchemists turned into chemists when they stopped keeping secrets. - Eric S. Raymond

Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or nearly irreversible - one-way doors - and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation. If you walk through and don't like what you see on the other side, you can't get back to where you were before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren't like that - they are changeable, reversible - they're two-way doors. If you've made a suboptimal Type 2 decision, you don't have to live with the consequences for that long. You can reopen the door and go back through. Type 2 decisions can and should be made quickly by high judgement individuals or small groups. - Jeff Bezos

The main job of a senior leader is to identify two or three important ideas and then to enforce great execution against those big ideas. The good news is that the big ideas are usually incredibly easy to identify. You shouldn't need to think about them very much you already know what they are. For Amazon the big ideas are low prices, fast delivery and vast selection. - Jeff Bezos

The get rich slowly schemes are not big sellers on infomercials. - Jeff Bezos

I've noticed all overnight successes take about 10 years. - Jeff Bezos

A dreamy business product has at least four characteristics: customers love it, it can grow to very large size, it has strong returns on capital, and it’s durable in time—with the potential to endure for decades. When you find one of these, don’t just swipe right, get married. - Jeff Bezos (2014)
%
When we're at our best, we don't wait for external pressures. We are internally driven to improve our services, adding benefits and features, before we have to. We lower prices and increase value for customers before we have to. We invent before we have to. - Jeff Bezos (2012)
%
I am emphasizing the self-service nature of these platforms because it’s important for a reason I think is somewhat non-obvious: even well-meaning gatekeepers slow innovation. When a platform is self-service, even the improbable ideas can get tried. - Jeff Bezos (2011)
%
Many of the problems we face have no textbook solutions, and so we — happily — invent new approaches. - Jeff Bezos (2010)
%
Working backwards from customer needs can be contrasted with a ‘skills-forward’ approach where existing skills and competencies are used to drive business opportunities. The skills-forward approach says, ‘We are really good at X. What else can we do with X?’ That’s a useful and rewarding business approach. However, if used exclusively, the company employing it will never be driven to develop fresh skills. - Jeff Bezos (2008)
%
Math-based decisions command wide agreement, whereas judgment-based decisions are rightly debated and often controversial, at least until put into practice and demonstrated. Any institution unwilling to endure controversy must limit itself to decisions of the first type. In our view, doing so would not only limit controversy — it would also significantly limit innovation and long-term value creation. - Jeff Bezos (2005)
%
Earnings don't directly translate into cash flows, and shares are worth only the present value of their future cash flows. - Jeff Bezos (2004)
%
Long-term thinking is both a requirement and an outcome of true ownership. Owners are different from tenants. I know of a couple who rented out their house, and the family who moved in nailed their Christmas tree to the hardwood floors instead of using a tree stand. Expedient, I suppose, and admittedly these were particularly bad tenants, but no owner would be so short-sighted. Similarly, many investors are effectively short-term tenants, turning their portfolios so quickly they are really just renting the stocks that they temporarily 'own.' - Jeff Bezos (2003)

Though negative reviews cost us some sales in the short term, helping customers make better purchase decisions ultimately pays off for the company. - Jeff Bezos (2003)
%
Our pricing strategy does not attempt to maximize margin percentages, but instead seeks to drive maximum value for customers and thereby create a much larger bottom line. - Jeff Bezos (2003)
%
We're determined to offer both world-leading customer experience and the lowest possible prices, but to some this dual goal seems paradoxical if not downright quixotic. Traditional stores face a time-tested tradeoff between offering high-touch customer experience on the one hand and the lowest possible prices on the other. How can Amazon.com be trying to do both? - Jeff Bezos (2002)
%
The current online shopping experience is the worst it will ever be. We have a market-size unconstrained opportunity in an area where the underlying foundational technology we employ improves every day. That is not normal. - Jeff Bezos (1999)
%
Because of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than some companies. - Jeff Bezos (1997)

Still Day 1. - Jeff Bezos

Whatever you do there's going to be risk in your life, and risk is a necessary component of progress. - Jeff Bezos (2001)

Continually raise the bar and drive teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed. - Amazon leadership principle

Think Big: Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. Think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers. - Amazon leadership principle

Bias for Action: Speed matters. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. Value calculated risk taking. - Amazon leadership principle

The experienced operator makes the minimum number of actions, and the process output moves smoothly and quickly to the new level, while with an inexperienced operator it oscillates round the target value. - Lisanne Bainbridge (1983)

When manual take-over is needed there is likely to be something wrong with the process, so that unusual actions will be needed to control it, and one can argue that the operator needs to be more rather than less skilled, and less rather than more loaded, than average. - Lisanne Bainbridge (1983)
