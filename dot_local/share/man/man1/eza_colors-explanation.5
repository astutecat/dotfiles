.SH Eza Color Explanation
.PP
eza provides its own built\-in set of file extension mappings that cover
a large range of common file extensions, including documents, archives,
media, and temporary files.
Any mappings in the environment variables will override this default
set: running eza with \f[C]LS_COLORS="*.zip=32"\f[] will turn zip files
green but leave the colours of other compressed files alone.
.PP
You can also disable this built\-in set entirely by including a
\f[C]reset\f[] entry at the beginning of \f[C]EZA_COLORS\f[].
So setting \f[C]EZA_COLORS="reset:*.txt=31"\f[] will highlight only text
files; setting \f[C]EZA_COLORS="reset"\f[] will highlight nothing.

.IP \[bu] 2
Cryptographic files (asc, enc, p12) are a faint blue.
.IP \[bu] 2
Documents (pdf, doc, dvi) are a less faint blue.
.IP \[bu] 2
Compressed files (zip, tgz, Z) are red.

Compiled files (class, o, pyc) are faint orange.
A file is also counted as compiled if it uses a common extension and is
in the same directory as one of its source files: styles.css will count
as compiled when next to styles.less or styles.sass, and scripts.js when
next to scripts.ts or scripts.coffee.
